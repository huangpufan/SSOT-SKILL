# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The current `main` branch is the only supported version. Tagged releases on
`main` track the bundle's `VERSION` file; fixes land on `main` and are picked
up by re-running the installer.

| Version       | Supported |
| ------------- | --------- |
| `main` (HEAD) | Yes       |
| Older tags    | No        |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** file public GitHub issues for security reports.

Email: huangpufan.cn@gmail.com

You can expect an acknowledgement within 48 hours. After triage we will
coordinate a fix, a disclosure window, and (when appropriate) a CVE.

## Threat Surface

SSOT-SKILL ships:

- A Bash installer (`install.sh`) that copies skill bundles into an agent's
  config directory and may shell out to `git`, `curl`, and standard POSIX
  utilities.
- Shell test scaffolding under `tests/*.sh` and a lint helper
  (`ssot-lint.sh`).
- Markdown protocol documents and templates under `skills/`.

The bundle does not run a long-lived service. The realistic attack surface
is therefore the installer and the shell scripts it invokes. When reporting
or reviewing a vulnerability, please flag any path in the installer that:

- Executes downloaded or templated content without integrity checks.
- Expands untrusted input into a shell command (`eval`, unquoted
  variables, command substitution from network sources).
- Writes outside the user-selected install target.

Markdown-only changes (protocols, templates, references) are generally
out of scope unless they instruct an agent to take a destructive action
without confirmation.
