## What This Repo Is

SSOT-SKILL is a skill bundle that gives a software repository a small, maintained memory in `SSOT/`: what the project is for, how it works, the rules people decided, why things are the way they are, and the traps. [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md) explains why it is shaped this way, including what version 3 removed. The bundle contains six skills:

| Skill | Role |
|-------|------|
| `ssot-preflight` | Read the relevant memory before substantive work |
| `ssot-bootstrap` | Create, continue, or migrate a repository's SSOT (with the user's agreement) |
| `ssot-closeout` | Record durable changes after a substantive batch; writes nothing when none |
| `ssot-doctor` | Check, review, or catch up SSOT |
| `ssot-audit` | Compatibility name; routes to Doctor's catch-up |
| `ssot-skill` | Compatibility name; routes to the four above |

## Install

When a user asks you to install or reinstall this bundle, follow [`INSTALL.md`](./INSTALL.md). The short form:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huangpufan/SSOT-SKILL/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --quickstart
```

For upgrade or uninstall, see `bash install.sh --help`.

## Usage

In consuming repositories, complete the instruction wiring in [`INSTALL.md`](./INSTALL.md), then restart the agent session. Users describe tasks normally; the agent selects the matching skills automatically.

The consumer instruction block lives in the bootstrap adapter template ([English](./skills/ssot-bootstrap/assets/templates/en/adapter-thin.md), [中文](./skills/ssot-bootstrap/assets/templates/zh/adapter-thin.md)), between the `SSOT-SKILL:BEGIN` / `SSOT-SKILL:END` markers. The installer prints that same block; maintain its wording there. Each skill's `SKILL.md` owns the detailed protocol.

## Language

- Skill protocol text (`SKILL.md`, `references/`) is in English for routing accuracy.
- Bootstrap templates ship in both `en/` and `zh/`; the installer copies one language based on `--lang`.
- Consumer-facing `SSOT/` documentation follows the `language` in the consumer's `SSOT/README.md` front matter.

## Repo Boundaries

- `install.sh` is the installer entrypoint; change it only for the skill list, the agent registry, or how sources are fetched (`--ref`).
- `skills/*/SKILL.md` is the protocol authority for each skill; `skills/ssot-preflight/references/memory-model.md` owns the consumer memory model they share.
- Protocol changes follow [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md#changing-the-protocol), including the budgets CI enforces.
- `skills/ssot-bootstrap/assets/templates/{en,zh}/` contains template files; keep `en/` and `zh/` in file-name parity.
- `skills/*/agents/openai.yaml` must stay in sync with each skill.
- `VERSION` and `skills/ssot-preflight/SKILL.md` `metadata.protocol_version` must match (CI enforces).
- `CHANGELOG.md` follows Keep a Changelog format.

## Commit Discipline (Global)

This section applies to **maintainers operating against `origin/main` directly**. External contributors follow [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) — that is the single entry point for community PRs.

Every modification to this repository — code, templates, docs, installer, tests — MUST end with `git commit && git push` to `origin/main` as the final step of the task. Do not leave changes in the working tree at the end of a turn.

- Direct commits to `main` are the established pattern for maintainers on this repo; external contributors go through `CONTRIBUTING.md` (branch + PR).
- Group related edits into a single commit per task; do not split into per-file commits.
- Commit message follows the `<type>: <subject>` form used in `git log` (e.g. `docs:`, `feat(protocol):`, `fix:`, `vX.YY (low|medium|high):` for protocol bumps).
- Run any relevant local check before committing (`bash tests/test-bundle-shape.sh` for shape, links, and budgets; `python3 tests/test-ssot-check.py` for checker changes; `bash tests/test-installer-e2e.sh` for installer changes); a failing check is a blocker, not a footnote.
- If the user explicitly says "don't push" or "stage only", that overrides this rule for that turn only — it does not change the default.

## Writing Style (Global)

KISS is the permanent SSOT design principle: choose the shortest **reliable path to understanding**, not the fewest words. Keep one fact in one owner and make tables serve prose rather than replace it; never compress away the context, causal story, boundary, current path, failure behavior, or current-versus-planned distinction a cold reader needs. Every SSOT document the bundle generates is first written for the stranger who lands tonight knowing nothing. That reader may be the next agent, or a person who delegates implementation without reading code: lead with the situation, the decision, the result they should see and the evidence that shows it, then when to stop and ask; explain unavoidable terms before exact tokens, commands, paths, or codes. Tables, codes and tags the reader cannot interpret are not paragraphs. The same rules apply to this repository's own docs. [`memory-model.md` §6](./skills/ssot-preflight/references/memory-model.md#6-writing-for-a-cold-reader) is the unique owner of the writing rules the bundle ships; templates and skills link to it rather than restating it.
