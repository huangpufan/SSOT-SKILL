# Contributing to SSOT Skill

Thanks for your interest in improving the SSOT Skill bundle. Read [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md) first: it explains why the bundle is small and what it deliberately does not do.

## What lives where

| Area | Files | Review weight |
|---|---|---|
| Protocol | `skills/*/SKILL.md`, `skills/*/references/*.md`, templates | Protocol review (below) |
| Engineering | `install.sh`, `skills/ssot-doctor/assets/scripts/`, `tests/`, `.github/workflows/` | Standard review |
| Docs | `README*`, `INSTALL.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` | Standard review |

`skills/ssot-preflight/references/memory-model.md` owns what a consumer's `SSOT/` contains and how it is written. The `SKILL.md` files link to it rather than restating it.

## Changing the protocol

Every protocol change answers four questions in its pull request:

1. **Does this belong in a general protocol?** A rule specific to one project belongs in that project. A problem caused by a template is fixed in the template, and a tool bug is fixed in the tool. Do not turn one mistake into a new duty for every repository.
2. **What does it replace?** Name the duty it adds, merges, or removes. Adding is allowed when nothing existing can carry it. Explain why, and keep within the budgets.
3. **How was it verified, at the level of its impact?** A wording fix needs the structural tests. A local rule needs a scenario where it should apply and a nearby one where it should not. A change to what agents read or write by default needs a baseline/candidate trial on real tasks that records wrong decisions, false triggers, reading, and writing.
4. **What is the net effect on whole tasks?** Fixing one case while making every unrelated task read or write more is not an improvement.

Do not claim more than you ran. A structural test does not show that agents behave better.

### Writing a SKILL.md

An entrypoint lets an agent pick the right branch, find its instructions, respect its boundaries, and know when it is done. Keep:

- the purpose and the condition for being done;
- routing, with links that say when to read them;
- ordered steps where the order affects safety or correctness;
- permission, ownership, and recovery rules the agent needs before choosing a route.

Detailed shared material belongs in a reference, read at the point of use. `SKILL.md` and `references/` are in English, the language skill routing is tuned for.

### Protocol budgets

`tests/test-bundle-shape.sh` enforces these limits in CI:

| What | Limit |
|---|---|
| All `SKILL.md` files together | 3,000 words |
| Everything an agent may read at runtime (`SKILL.md` + `references/`) | 8,000 words |
| Templates, per language | 16 KiB |
| `ssot-check.py` | 40 KiB |
| All of `skills/` | 160 KiB |

A budget is a reason to rethink responsibilities, never a reason to cut a recovery or authorization branch to fit. A v2 word cap once rejected a complete entrypoint for being complete. Raising a limit requires the same evidence as adding a rule. Record the reason in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Versions

`VERSION` and `metadata.protocol_version` in `skills/ssot-preflight/SKILL.md` must match; CI checks this. Bump the minor version for protocol changes and add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry. The consumer data format (`ssot_format` in `SSOT/README.md`) changes only when existing SSOTs would otherwise be misread. That needs a major version and a migration path in `ssot-bootstrap`.

## Templates

Templates under `skills/ssot-bootstrap/assets/templates/{en,zh}/` are copied into consumer repositories. Keep both languages in file-name parity. They are prompts for prose, not forms: avoid tables that invite one-word cells, and in Mermaid diagrams use `%%` comments, never HTML comments.

## Local verification

```bash
bash tests/test-bundle-shape.sh        # shape, links, budgets
python3 tests/test-ssot-check.py       # checker regression tests
bash tests/test-installer-e2e.sh       # installer end to end
shellcheck -S warning -e SC2034 install.sh tests/*.sh
```

For diagram changes, install `mermaid@11.12.0` and `jsdom@26.1.0` into an isolated npm prefix, then run `node tests/test-mermaid-templates.mjs <prefix>/node_modules`.

## Pull request checklist

- [ ] The four protocol questions are answered (protocol changes only)
- [ ] Local verification passes, including budgets
- [ ] `VERSION` and `CHANGELOG.md` updated for protocol changes
- [ ] `en/` and `zh/` templates updated together
- [ ] `README.md` and `README.zh.md` kept in sync for user-facing changes

## Code of conduct

Be kind. Surface disagreements with evidence and proposed alternatives, not broad rejection.
