# <Project name>

<!-- In a few sentences of plain prose: who this is for, what it does for
them, and what it deliberately does not do. After this paragraph a newcomer
should be able to explain the project to someone else. -->

## Map

<!-- One line per SSOT file that exists. Delete lines for files you did not
create; add lines for folders such as architecture/ when a file was split. -->

- [Product](product.md): who uses it, what it promises, and what it does not do.
- [Architecture](architecture.md): the parts, who owns which state, the key flows, and failure handling.
- [Process](process.md): how to build, test, release, and deploy.
- [Decisions](decisions/): why things are the way they are, including the options we rejected.
- [Gotchas](gotchas.md): traps that have already cost time.
- [Glossary](glossary.md): project terms a newcomer would misread.

## Task routes

<!-- Map the kinds of work this repository really sees to what to read first.
Replace the example row. -->

| When the task… | Read first | Also check |
|---|---|---|
| changes how payments are retried | [Architecture: retries](architecture.md#failure-and-recovery) | [INV-01](#invariants) |

## Invariants

These are rules people decided and the implementation must preserve. An agent
never changes a rule's meaning, scope, or status on its own: a task that
conflicts with a confirmed rule stops and asks the user. A candidate rule was
inferred and still waits for the user; follow it by default, and ask the user
before departing from it.

| ID | Kind | Rule | Explained in | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

<!-- Example row:
| INV-01 | product promise | A retry never charges twice | [Retries](architecture.md#failure-and-recovery) | confirmed | user, 2026-05-02 |
Kind: product promise, architecture invariant, or process rule.
Status: confirmed = set by a person; candidate = inferred by an agent, waiting
for the user; retired = no longer applies (link the decision). If there are
none yet, keep the empty table and say so in one sentence. -->

## Open questions

<!-- Unresolved decisions and known gaps that affect work. For each: what is
open, which work it blocks, and where the details live. Delete an entry once
it is resolved. If there are none, say so. -->
