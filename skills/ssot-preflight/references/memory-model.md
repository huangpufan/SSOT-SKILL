# The SSOT Memory Model

This file owns what a repository's `SSOT/` contains, where each kind of
knowledge lives, and how it is written. The other SSOT skills link here.

## 1. What SSOT is for

`SSOT/` is the repository's long-term memory. A new agent, or a person who
delegates work to agents, should be able to read it and know what the project
is for, how it works, which rules must not be broken, why things are the way
they are, and where the traps are. With that, they can plan a change without
first reconstructing the whole codebase.

SSOT is memory, not a verification system. The code, configuration, schemas,
tests, and observed runtime behavior remain the evidence for what the system
does today. Proof that one task works belongs in that task's commit, pull
request, or test run, not in SSOT.

"Single source of truth" means each durable fact is explained in exactly one
place inside `SSOT/`, its **owner**. Other places link to the owner instead of
repeating it. When a repository has other documents (a public README, a
`docs/` folder, design notes), their durable facts move into `SSOT/`, and the
old copy becomes a short pointer or is marked as historical. A public README
may keep its summary for outside readers, but `SSOT/` is the place that is kept
current.

## 2. What to store, and what to leave out

Store a fact when all three hold:

1. The code and git history cannot cheaply tell a reader this.
2. It would change a future decision or prevent a mistake.
3. It changes more slowly than people will maintain it.

Typical durable knowledge:

- **Intent.** Who the product serves, the problem it solves, its promises and
  non-goals.
- **System understanding.** The parts of the system and what each owns, which
  part holds which state, how a request flows, how failures are contained and
  recovered, and which boundaries must not be crossed. A reader only gets this
  by studying many files, so writing it down saves real work.
- **Rules and decisions.** Invariants set by people, decisions with their
  reasons, and the alternatives that were rejected and why. A rejected path is
  worth recording so nobody revives it by accident.
- **Traps.** Problems that cost real time, with their cause and the right
  approach.
- **How to work here.** The commands and checks for building, testing,
  releasing, and deploying, and the environment quirks they depend on.

Leave out:

- **Restated code.** Field lists, schema version numbers, function signatures,
  configuration values, and file inventories. Name the file that holds them
  instead. This content changes fastest, and a stale copy misleads more than a
  missing one.
- **Proof of one task.** Test output, exit codes, hashes, screenshots, and
  "verified on <date>" diaries. Keep a one-line pointer only when a long-term
  conclusion depends on that evidence. For example: "Rejected polling after
  the 2026-03 load test showed 40% CPU idle burn (see PR #812)."
- **History of edits.** Git already records who changed what and when.
- **Status about the documentation itself.** No coverage labels, review
  ledgers, or "last checked" stamps. A note on where a fact came from ("seen
  on the production server, 2026-09") is different: that is the fact's
  source, and it may stay.

## 3. Current, planned, and unknown

Readers act on what you write, so never present something planned as if it
exists. Use plain labels near the claim:

- Describe current behavior in the present tense.
- Mark anything decided but not built, for example: "Planned, not built yet:
  … (see decision 0012)". Remove the label when it ships, or rewrite the text
  if the plan changes.
- Say what is unknown. "We have not verified this on macOS" is useful.
  Silence is not.

When a document and the code disagree, the code describes current behavior.
Find out whether the document is stale, the code violates an intended rule, or
the intent has not been implemented yet, and fix the document or report the
violation accordingly.

A claim about verification must say how far the verification went. "Unit
tests pass" does not support "works end to end", and evidence from one
platform does not cover another. A performance number says how and when it
was measured. Keep four things apart: what was decided, what the code does,
what one run showed, and what is guaranteed in general.

## 4. Layout

```text
SSOT/
├── README.md        required: entry point, task routes, invariants, open questions
├── product.md       who uses it, what problem, promises, non-goals, main journeys
├── architecture.md  parts, state ownership, key flows, failure and recovery, boundaries
├── process.md       build, run, test, release, and deploy; required checks
├── decisions/       one file per consequential decision: NNNN-short-title.md
├── gotchas.md       traps: symptom, cause, what to do instead
├── glossary.md      project terms that a newcomer would misread
└── research/        investigations whose conclusions still guide decisions
```

Only `README.md` is required. Create the others when there is real content
for them. Never create empty placeholder files. When a file grows past about
16,000 characters or covers clearly separate topics, turn it into a folder of the same
name, with a `README.md` that introduces the topic and routes to one file per
subtopic (for example `architecture/README.md` plus
`architecture/payments.md`).

Repositories that already use other names, such as v2's `01-product/` and
`02-architecture/`, keep them. The README's routes decide where things are, so
renaming is never required.

### The README

`SSOT/README.md` is the entry point every task starts from, so keep it short,
around 8,000 characters. It starts with front matter:

```yaml
---
ssot_format: 3
language: en        # the language SSOT prose is written in, e.g. en or zh-CN
reviewed_through: 1a2b3c4   # optional: the next catch-up starts after this commit
---
```

`reviewed_through` marks where the next catch-up starts. Setup sets it to the
commit whose code it explored, and a `$ssot-doctor` catch-up moves it to the
end of the range it processed in full. It is a starting point, not a
certificate: it does not say that every earlier fact was recorded or that
SSOT is correct. Ordinary closeouts leave it alone, because they cover only
their own batch, and commits made outside that workflow may still hold
unrecorded facts.

Then, in this order:

1. **What this project is.** A few sentences of plain prose: who it is for,
   what it does, and what it deliberately does not do.
2. **Map.** Which file answers which kind of question.
3. **Task routes.** A table from task signals (for example "touches billing",
   "changes the CLI", "release") to the files to read first. A table fits here
   because readers look things up in it.
4. **Invariants.** The register in section 5.
5. **Open questions.** Unresolved decisions and known gaps that affect work.
   Each one gets a line saying what is open, what work it blocks, and where
   the details live. Remove an entry when it is resolved.

### Decisions

Write a decision record when a choice is consequential: costly to reverse,
affecting more than one part, overturning an earlier decision, or likely to be
questioned later. This applies to product and process choices as well as
technical ones. Routine edits do not need one, and neither does a choice whose
reasons already live in another owner.

Each record says, in prose: the situation, the decision, the alternatives
considered and why they lost, the consequences, the date, and who decided (a
user directive, a team review, or an agent proposal that the user accepted).
Its status is one of `accepted`, `superseded by NNNN`, or `retired`. A retired
decision no longer applies and needs no successor. A superseded one names its
replacement. Do not delete old decisions, because they explain why the
rejected paths stay rejected. An accepted decision that a person made or
approved binds like a rule: changing it takes that person's agreement,
recorded as a new decision that supersedes it.

### Research

A research note records an investigation whose result still guides work.
Keep the question, how it was investigated, what was found, including the
approaches that failed, and what was not checked. A bare conclusion cannot be
re-judged when circumstances change. Put the conclusion that a decision relies
on in that decision, and link the note for the method.

### Temporary workarounds and deferrals

When a change adds a temporary workaround, a compatibility shim, or a
`TODO`/`HACK` that future work must know about, note it in the owner of the
affected part. Say why it exists and what condition allows its removal. When
you defer a known problem, record what was deferred, why, and what would
trigger revisiting it. "Later" on its own is not a record.

## 5. Invariants

An invariant is a rule that people decided and that the implementation must
preserve. The register in the README lists them:

```markdown
| ID | Kind | Rule | Explained in | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| INV-01 | product promise | A retry never charges twice | [Payments](architecture.md#retries) | confirmed | user, 2026-05-02 |
| INV-02 | process rule | The CLI keeps backward-compatible flags | [Process](process.md#compatibility) | candidate | inferred from the release notes |
```

**Kind** says what the rule protects. A *product promise* is something users
rely on, an *architecture invariant* is a property the system must keep, and
a *process rule* governs how people and agents work in the repository.

A rule belongs here when a person set it as a lasting constraint on future
work: "never add pop-up notifications", "a retry never charges twice", "no
public release without approval", "every UI change gets a native
screenshot". A one-time choice, such as a retention period or which library
to use, is a decision: record it in `decisions/` or its owner, where it still
binds and still needs the person to change it. Keep each row to one line;
the register is read before every task.

- **confirmed.** A person established it, either by a direct instruction or
  by accepting a decision. Agents may change code, tests, and docs within the
  rule, but never its meaning, scope, or status. If a task conflicts with it,
  stop and ask the user. If reality already violates it, report the violation
  instead of rewriting the rule to match the code.
- **candidate.** An agent inferred the rule, for example during setup. Follow
  it by default. When a task needs to depart from it, or its meaning is
  unclear in a way that matters, ask the user to confirm or drop it and
  record the answer; silence confirms nothing. That the code already behaves
  this way does not make it confirmed.
- **retired.** It no longer applies. Keep the row so the history stays
  readable, and link the decision that retired it.

When a user states a lasting rule ("never X", "always Y", "from now on"),
record it as a confirmed invariant with the user and date as its source. The
explanation lives in the owner the row links to, inside `SSOT/`.

An open question blocks only the work that depends on its answer. Unrelated
work continues.

## 6. Writing for a cold reader

Write every SSOT file for a reader who arrives knowing nothing about the
project. That reader may be the next agent, or a person who delegates the
implementation and does not read the code. A document that confuses a new
person also misleads an agent.

- **Lead with the situation.** Say who is doing what and why it matters
  before describing the mechanism. Then give the details: names, paths, and
  commands. An entry document (the README, or the top of an area) should
  explain the current path, what the user sees, and the main boundaries on
  its own; links are for depth, not for assembling the basic picture.
- **Make it delegable.** For anything a reader might hand to an agent, say
  what result they should see, what evidence would show it, and when to
  stop and ask.
- **Use plain words.** Prefer the ordinary word to the internal label. The
  first time you use a project-specific term, explain it in positive terms,
  enough for this paragraph to make sense. A link to the glossary adds the
  full definition but does not replace that local explanation. You may
  explain a term again in context, but do not give it a different meaning. Keep identifiers, enum values, commands, and
  quoted text exactly as they are, even in a document written in another
  language.
- **Explain in prose, look up in tables.** Paragraphs carry reasons, causes,
  and consequences. Use tables for lookups and comparisons. If a cell needs a
  sentence of reasoning, that reasoning belongs in a paragraph.
- **Be concrete.** One real example ("a retry after a gateway timeout") makes
  a rule easier to apply than an abstract description does.
- **Keep one fact in one place.** Link instead of copying. When you change a
  fact, search `SSOT/` and the agent instruction files for older statements
  of it and fix them too.
- **Write in the declared language.** Use the README's `language`.
- **Make diagrams parse.** In Mermaid diagrams, write comments with Mermaid's
  own `%%` syntax, never `<!-- -->` inside the fence, because Mermaid rejects
  HTML comments.

Length is not the goal in either direction. Write as much as a newcomer needs
to understand the point, and nothing that only restates the code.

## 7. The format marker and older layouts

`ssot_format: 3` in the README's front matter marks this model. The bundle's
own version number can change without changing the format, and a new bundle
release never obliges a repository to "catch up".

A repository whose `SSOT/README.md` lacks `ssot_format: 3` uses an earlier
model, usually v2 with `SSOT/STATUS.md`. Its coverage labels and review
records are historical, but the decisions, user constraints, limits, and open
questions it records still apply. Do not write to it, because mixing models
leaves ledgers that contradict updated documents; offer to migrate it with
`$ssot-bootstrap` instead.
